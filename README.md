# KidsEnroll

## Project Description

KidsEnroll is a web application designed to streamline the management of extracurricular activities in preschools and kindergartens. It features two main panels:

- **Administrator Panel**: Allows management of class offerings, instructors, and user accounts.
- **Parent Panel**: Enables parents to browse available classes and enroll their children.

This digital solution replaces inefficient manual methods, providing a centralized platform to manage all activity enrollments.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro 5**: For building fast and efficient web pages with minimal JavaScript.
- **React 19**: Powers interactive components within the application.
- **TypeScript 5**: Provides static type checking and enhances development tooling.
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Enables rapid and responsive design with utility-first styling.
- **Shadcn/ui**: Offers a collection of accessible React UI components.
- **Supabase**: Serves as the backend for authentication and database management.
- **Openrouter.ai**: Integrates with various AI models for extended functionalities.
